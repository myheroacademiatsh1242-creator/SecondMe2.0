# Loading screen art

The forest behind everything is not an image: it is pixel art drawn in code
(`src/game/loading/pixelForest.ts`) into its own canvas, screen-wide, so it runs on past the
frame on any screen shape. The arch, the bar's stone channel and the title below are drawn on
it while loading; the painting they were cut from (`background.jpg`) is not shown.

| File | Made by | From |
|---|---|---|
| `background.jpg` | `tools/assets/prepare_loading_screen.py` | `tools/assets/source/loading-mockup.png` (painted mockup; the live UI is erased from it) |
| `portal-swirl.png` | same script | the mockup's portal vortex, cut out (turned in the portal transition). The painted energy streaks right of the arch are removed from `background.jpg` |
| `portal-vortex.png` | `tools/assets/prepare_portal_anim.py` | `tools/assets/source/portal-anim-sheet.png`: 10 hand-drawn vortex frames fitted to the painted arch's oval; placement in `src/game/data/portalAnim.json` |
| `wizard-run.png` | `tools/assets/prepare_wizard_run.py` | `tools/assets/source/wizard-run-sheet.png` (8-frame run cycle) |
| `portal-arch.png`, `portal-front.png`, `bar-frame.png`, `title.png`, `background-empty.jpg` | `tools/assets/prepare_portal_transition.py` | `background.jpg`: the arch, the bar's stone channel and the title cut out as sprites, and the painting without them, for the portal transition |
| `bar-frame.png` (cleaned in place) | `tools/assets/clean_bar_frame.py` | strips of the painting's forest left around the channel, removed so it sits on the pixel forest |

The layout data lives in `src/game/data/loadingLayout.json` and `src/game/data/wizardRun.json`.
The code is in `src/game/loading/` (scene, preloader) and `src/components/LoadingScreen.tsx`.

The screen shows on the first load into the lobby (every asset) and whenever a level is
entered: picking a level, the next level, the boss, or Continue. A level load fetches only
the files that level uses and skips what is already loaded. Restarting a level stays instant.

Rebuild after changing a source image:

```bash
python -I -X utf8 tools/assets/prepare_wizard_run.py
python -I -X utf8 tools/assets/prepare_loading_screen.py
python -I -X utf8 tools/assets/prepare_portal_transition.py   # after prepare_loading_screen.py
python -I -X utf8 tools/assets/prepare_portal_anim.py         # after prepare_loading_screen.py
python -I -X utf8 tools/assets/clean_bar_frame.py             # after prepare_portal_transition.py
```

## Portal transition

When the destination art is ready, the main menu plays the wizard pull, moves the arch to
the centre, rotates it to face the camera, then opens the vortex and dives into it.
The final portal frame fades directly over the mounted chapter map. With reduced motion
or missing transition art, the loading screen fades straight to the destination.

There is no painted front view of the arch: `portal-front.png` is built from the painting by
mirroring the near pillar and the near half of the opening. The turn is one rigid slab
turning in perspective about the vertical axis through the opening's centre, drawn as thin
columns that all follow the same angle (so its top and bottom edges stay whole): from the
painting's angle (0.72 rad, fitted to the painted pillar and opening widths), near side face
showing, to facing the camera. The spiral is a WebGL fragment shader
(`src/game/loading/portalTwist.ts`) that warps the front-facing arch and vortex, redrawn into a
560 px layer each frame, along a counter-clockwise spiral, sampled nearest-neighbour so the
stones stay blocks of pixels. Without WebGL the arch just turns and shrinks in 2D. From 2x zoom
the dive renders at half resolution (same pixels).

## Dev checks (`pnpm dev` only; ignored in builds)

- The FPS / frame-time overlay shows in the top-left corner.
- `?loadDelay=250` delays each file by 250 ms, to watch progress the way it looks on a slow connection.
- `?holdLoading=1` keeps the screen up after 100%, for profiling.
- `?stress=4` multiplies particle counts by 4.
- In the console, `__loadingScene.transitionReport()` gives the real frame times of each transition stage.
- In the console, `__loadingScene.benchmark(200, true)` renders 200 frames back to back. It forces a GPU sync every frame and returns the per-frame cost.
